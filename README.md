## Overview

DDIP (Drug Developpment and pIC50 Prediction) is a programm based in a jupyter notebook format that can predict pIC50 values for different drugs acting on a target protein. To do so, different machine learning models (such as Forest, ... and ...) were tested in order to have the best prediction on pIC50 values. 

## üë©‚Äçüíª Installation

# Setup environment. 

To setup the enviromnent, you first you need to clone the repository on your local storage. 

```
git clone https://github.com/Thomas-Fischer98/PPchem_DDIP.git
```

Then you can create the environment.

```
conda create -n ppchem_ddip python=3.10 
```
Then you can activate the environment. 

```
conda activate ppchem_ddip
```

If you need jupyter lab, install it 

```
(ppchem_ddip) $ pip install jupyterlab
```

# Install packages



## üî• Usage

```python
from mypackage import main_func

# One line to rule them all
result = main_func(data)
```

This usage example shows how to quickly leverage the package's main functionality with just one line of code (or a few lines of code). 
After importing the `main_func` (to be renamed by you), you simply pass in your `data` and get the `result` (this is just an example, your package might have other inputs and outputs). 
Short and sweet, but the real power lies in the detailed documentation.
